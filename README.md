Coding Assignments completed for Machine Learning course from  Santa Clara University Graduate School of Computer Engineering.

A short decision tree project was made to train a model for decision trees for an iris flower data set as well as a housing data set.

All the remainign projects trained models using data from an iris flower data set.  The supervised learning algorithms used were linear regression, logistic regression, and discriminant analysis.  The unsupervised learning method used was k-means clustering.
